# Put step gems that you wish to include in your INK instance here.

# If you remove a step gem from this file, it will no longer be available to the INK API,
# recipes using an unavailable step will not execute, though users can still see the results
# from previous executions.

# After modifying this file, run `bin/load-new-step-gems` (the script includes `bundle install`)
